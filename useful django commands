start the django server:

migrate database
  #The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any
  necessary database tables according to the database settings in
  your mysite/settings.py file and the database migrations shipped with the app
  python manage.py migrate

make a new migration based on models in app
  #By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to
  your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes
  to be stored as a migration.
  python manage.py makemigrations appname

see the sql the new migration would make:
  python manage.py sqlmigrate appname 0001
